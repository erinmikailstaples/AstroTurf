# AstroTurf

Because the grass isn‚Äôt greener over there ‚Äî it‚Äôs greener where you water it. And by "water" we obviously mean open pull requests, triage issues, and sharpen mower blades in CI.

AstroTurf is a tiny, intentionally silly repo that treats your project like a lawn. PRs are seeds, issues are weeds, CI is the mower, and dashboards are‚Ä¶ well, lawn gnomes with charts.

## What is this?
A parody ‚Äúobservability‚Äù toy that generates a lawn dashboard and story out of repo-ish events. It updates a whimsical SVG and a short narrative in `garden.md`, backed by a JSON blob of totally serious lawn telemetry.

## The silly bits
- Seeds vs Weeds: PRs are seeds üå±, issues are weeds üåæ. Open one, watch the lawn stats wiggle.
- Lawn Health Index: A very robust, extremely scientific number out of 100.
- Lushness: 0‚Äì100% greenness. Higher = more grass blades drawn in the SVG.
- Sprinkler Pipelines: Cron-like watering jobs with flaky, wind-induced failures.
- Mower CI: Build warns, tests flake, blades occasionally unsharpened. Real-life vibes.
- Observability: Logs from `GnomeService` and `WeedDaemon`, traces like `bee-flight`.
- Security: Gnome firewall enabled. Mole tunnels detected. HedgeAuth via OIDC (Open Ivy Dandelion Connect).

## How it works
`scripts/garden_bot.py` is the whole show:
1. Reads and updates `lawn-health.json` with event-driven drift.
2. Writes a little story about your lawn‚Äôs current mood.
3. Renders `garden.svg` (a sky, a grass strip, and lines of narrative).
4. Refreshes `garden.md` to display the latest status and story.
5. Drops tiny breadcrumb files in `seedlings/` (for seeds) and `weeds/` (for weeds).

It can run in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) or locally. It looks for `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` and `GITHUB_REF_NAME` to guess what just happened, but it happily runs without them.

## What you‚Äôll see in the repo
- `scripts/garden_bot.py`: Generates everything and updates metrics with a wink.
- `garden.svg`: The live lawn card (auto-generated).
- `garden.md`: A short, auto-updated story plus the SVG.
- `lawn-health.json`: The canonical source of green truth and brown lies.
- `seedlings/`: One text file per planted seed (PR-ish).
- `weeds/`: One text file per new weed (issue-ish), created on demand.

## Run it locally
Requirements: Python 3.9+.

```bash
python3 scripts/garden_bot.py
```

That will:
- Update `lawn-health.json`
- Re-render `garden.svg`
- Refresh `garden.md`
- Potentially create `seedlings/` or `weeds/` entries

Open `garden.md` or `garden.svg` in your viewer of choice to admire the turf.

## Pretend you‚Äôre CI (for extra silliness)
Simulate different event types by setting `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`:

```bash
# Pretend an issue just opened
GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=issues python3 scripts/garden_bot.py

# Pretend a pull request just opened
GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=pull_request python3 scripts/garden_bot.py

# Nudge the lawn via a push or a scheduled tick
GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=push python3 scripts/garden_bot.py
GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=schedule python3 scripts/garden_bot.py
```

You can also optionally set a branch/ref-ish hint (parsed for numbers like PR IDs):

```bash
GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=pull_request GITHUB_REF_NAME=refs/pull/123/merge \
  python3 scripts/garden_bot.py
```

## Why does this exist?
Because SRE/DevOps dashboards needed more chlorophyll. It‚Äôs a playful nudge at metrics, pipelines, and the eternal struggle against dandelions (null pointers) and crabgrass (merge conflicts).

## Contributing
Plant a seed (PR). Pull a weed (close an issue). Water with tests. Mulch with docs. Beware aphids: flaky specs.
