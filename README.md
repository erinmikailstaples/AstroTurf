## Scriptable: Plant Haiku Widget (iOS)

You can enjoy silly plant-themed haikus on your iPhone using the Scriptable app.

Steps:

1. Install Scriptable from the App Store.
2. Open `scripts/Scriptable-Plant-Haikus.js` and copy its contents.
3. In Scriptable, create a new script and paste the code.
4. Run it directly to preview, or add it as a Home Screen widget:
   - Long-press the Home Screen → “+” → search “Scriptable”.
   - Choose Small widget → Add Widget.
   - Tap the widget → select the `Scriptable-Plant-Haikus` script.
   - Optionally set the widget to run on tap to cycle haikus.

The script randomly rotates between different plant-related haikus and shows a gentle green gradient background. If you run it inside this repo with Node, it will print a simple boxed preview to the console.
